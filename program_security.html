                There are necessary steps that need to be taken in order to keep yourself and your company secure. There
                are many types of security breaches which may leave you and your company vulnerable to such as errors
                and viruses. There are steps in order to take
                which will help to keep you secure from these breeches which may have been caused by bad programming.
            </p>

            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">

                <li>Bad programming or coding may leave you vulnerable to viruses, worms or trojan horses.</li>

                <li>Bad programming on video games may leave the game open to exploitation and cheating.</li>

                <li>Not all programmers create good code so there must be a process of protecting the good code from the

                </li>

                <li>Keeping all programming’s from having flaws.</li>

                <li>We all may access situations in different ways and may not understand the risks of bad coding.</li>

                <li>New ways of breeching programs may be introduced which programmers may not know how to defend
                    against.
